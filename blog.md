# Blog Thoughts


## C++ entry
	> I totally feel that C++ is elegant in the way it's written. As a python programmer, I find it refreshing to type in it. 

## Watch Conference Videos
	> CppCon
	> CppNorth
	> etc...

## Build something fun
	> Use everything you learned
	> Better yet, use something you don't understand that well


## Don't forget to have fun.
	> It can be taxing learning a new language
	> So don't forget to have fun with it


## Breaks again
	> Take a break and relax no code is ok
	> You aren't going to forget everything you learned. 
	> Keep it to a day or so

## Don't be afraid of a book
	> Don't be afraid of a book literally means that.
	> I learned C++ reading a 1400 page book cover to cover
	> No I didn't retain everything, but I sure did learn a lot. 

## Learn the basic

	> I mean really learn the basics.
	> You would be surprised how much you can do with knowing the basics.
	> Spend your time with them, get good with them.

## Vim Series
	> Vim with a good linter is amazing
	> Challenge yourself to learn to write in it
	> Learn how to open files
	>  

## Podcasts

	> Listen to podcasts
	> Talk pyton to me
	> Code newbie
	> Changelog
	> Cpp chat
	> Cpp cast
	> CPP weekly with Jason Turner
	> Listen even if you don't completely understand everything
	etc...

## Build Something
	> Who cares what it is just build it. It's all about muscle memory and repetition. 

# Feature Creep (not my phrase) 
	> Slow down, building is great, but just make something that works. The worst is building something and it doesn't work because you put so much in it and over complicated it. 
##c/c++
	> Will make you a better programmer


## day off
	> Its OK to take a day off from coding. It gets tiring and your brain will thank you. 

## practice what you learned.
	> Build something. You are learning to code you know. 
	> So built it, smart dumb large small useful useless whatever just build something and use what you just learned. 
	> If you learned functions then go write two functions one for hello one for world and go call them both! 

## take breaks 
	> when you learn something hard or your struggling take a break and think on it. Sometimes that may be days some time it may be hours but take breaks. 

## Python
	> Rich is a great library if you aren't using it you should. 

## C
	> Wrote a c program today from documentation. Was just a simple "Hello World" but I compiled in with GCC
	> and it ran. Was a printf but it threw it out into the terminal. The compiler didn't like it however, said it was deprecated.


## errors
	> I've learned so much about error handling the right way and the wrong way. Inside and outside of functions
	> always checking the inputs with if's and creating custom error handling procedures. It's very helpful. 
	> I've been able to transfer it to other languages such as python as well.

## compilers are so cool. 

	> I thought about how do libraries work today and realized the library is in the compiler


## System is powerful

	> Discovered the system() today. Man this thing is incredible


## Better Programmer
	> Learning C++ makes you a better programmer hands down. 
	> It has given me a better understanding of other languages for sure. 

## started learning C++ 

	> I'm reading a book call C++:Practice and Principles by Bjarne Stroustrup the creator of C++


## VS CODE
	> This has been interesting to use. I want to like it, but man there are other tools, and don't forget vim! 


## Vim
	> Have I mentioned that i love vim, I use it for so much stuff lol. I'm using it now to take notes. 
	> It's just the best and i want to write a lot about it.
